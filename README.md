# Team9
For the first demo, only the .java files are needed. (The .class can be created by compiling.)
All files ending in .java are needed for the demo except for Point.java. This class is currently only planned to be implemented in the future but is not essential for the demo.

COMPILING THE CODE
Place all files into a folder together. Using either windows command prompt or the OSX/LINUX console to navigate to this folder using the "cd [PathToDirectory]" command. Once in the appropriate directory, type in "javac *.java" to compile the code.

RUNNING THE GAME
To run the demo, first compile the code as described above. Then, in the console whilst in the directory containing all the game files, type in the command "java Game" and the demo will start. You will be greeted by the game's title, TOWER DEFENSE

THE DEMO
Press the Enter key to progress through the demo. At the start, the user will be asked which type of tower they would like to place first and then prompt the user for an X and Y coordinate. The coordinates must be with in 0 - 4 since the map is an array and the first coordinate would be (0,0)
